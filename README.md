# OGAM

### Overview
Directory *FNS* contains the main functions for the simulations and data applications. Specifically,
- *FNS_DataGene_Simu1* : function to generate data for simulation 1
- *FNS_DataGene_Simu2* : function to generate data for simulation 2
- *FNS_SmoBack* : functions to conduct smoothbackfitting
- *FNS_SmoBack_credit* : differs from *FNS_SmoBack* only in the stopping criterion

Directory *datasets* contains the datasets *credit* and *flight* for data applications. Due to the upload restrictions, we provide the preprocessed data here, which are seperated into several parts. Please merge them before processing. Raw data are available in the following links:
