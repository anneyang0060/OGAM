# Code for OGAM

### Overview

1. Directory *FNS* contains the main functions for the simulations and data applications. Specifically,
- *FNS_DataGene_Simu1* : function to generate data for simulation 1
- *FNS_DataGene_Simu2* : function to generate data for simulation 2
- *FNS_SmoBack* : functions to conduct smoothbackfitting
- *FNS_SmoBack_credit* : differs from *FNS_SmoBack* only in the stopping criterion

2. Directory *datasets* contains the datasets *credit* and *flight* for data applications. Due to the upload restrictions, we provide the preprocessed data here, which are seperated into several parts. Please **merge them before processing**. Raw data are available in the following links:
- *credit* : https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wb3ndt69gf (P2P_Macro_Data.dta, 3 GB)
- *flight* : https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/dataexpo/dataexpo2009

3. Directory *res* contains the analysis results of the simulations and data applications.

4. Directory *fig* contains the figures generated by the numerical experiments. 

5. Directory *Compare_Code* contains the code for simulation 3 to compare with other online nonparametric methods in the degenerated one-dimensional case.
